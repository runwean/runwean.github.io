# Hi there 👋

I am Wei Yuan, but you can call me Wayne:

- 📷 **Photography Enthusiast**: I have a keen interest in capturing moments through the lens. Whether it's landscapes or street scenes, I find joy in telling stories with my camera.
- 🏃 **Runner**: I love the feeling of the wind against my face as I run.
- 🏀 **Basketball Lover**: There's nothing like the thrill of a good game of basketball. I enjoy the camaraderie on the court and the satisfaction of a well-executed shot.
- 🏋️ **Fitness Fanatic**: I lift weights, not just for physical benefits but also for the mental clarity and discipline it brings.
- 💻 **Tech Enthusiast**: I'm currently diving deep into the world of Large Language Models (LLM). The intersection of technology and language fascinates me, and I'm always eager to learn more.
- 📚 **Lifelong Learner**: I have a passion for continuous learning and personal growth. I believe that every day is a new opportunity to learn something new.

🍵 ☕️ 🍺 ... Enjoying a variety of beverages!
